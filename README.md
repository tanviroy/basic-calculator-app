# Basic Calculator App ðŸ“±ðŸ’™
#### Date of completion: 23rd June 2020

## Description
This is a Basic Calculator App. The word "basic" is important as it isn't a replacement to the calculator app on most devices. I had come across Flutter this last month and after installing Android Studio and Flutter, and learning Dart, playing around with Flutter has been really fun. For those familiar with C++/Java, Dart will be easy to pick up. Personally, delving into something new from scratch was challenging - the project + preparation took me a whole week. This was a fun exploratory project. I am currently unsure of how keen I am to explore this field, but am excited to possibly use Flutter more in the future. Flutter (+ Dart) definitely seems to make app development easier and more accessible.
